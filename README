efloat: Embedable Float manipulation library

The goal of this library is to provide functions which can be added
to embedded projects, especially those which wish to transfer
floating point data without paying the cost of string conversion.
Not all platforms have 32 and 64 bit floats, thus the library tries
to be resilient to this. For example all of "float", "double" and
"long double" types on the "avr" platform are 32 bits, there is no
"float64" when building for avr, only "float32".

Assuming IEEE 754 (radix 2), transforming the exponent is a bit tricky, but
the bit layout is straight-forward:

float32 Sign	Exponent	Significand (mantissa)
float32 1 [31]	8 [30-23]	23 [22-00]
float32 SEEEEEEE EMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM

float64 Sign	Exponent	Significand (mantissa)
float64 1 [63]	11 [62-52]	52 [51-00]
float64 SEEEEEEE EEEEMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMMMMMM

Overview
--------

Before including efloat.h, ensure that stdint.h compatible typedefs
for fixed width integers have been declared, and the following
float.h vales are defined:

 * FLT_RADIX (at this time only FLT_RADIX == 2 is supported)
 * FLT_MAX_EXP
 * FLT_MANT_DIG
 * DBL_MAX_EXP
 * DBL_MANT_DIG
 * LDBL_MAX_EXP
 * LDBL_MANT_DIG

#include <efloat.h>

 * If "float", "double", or "long double" are either 32 or 64 bits,
   the values "efloat_float", "efloat_double", and/or "efloat_long_double"
   will be #defined to be either 32 or 64.

 * Headder attempts to typedef two types: "efloat32" and "efloat64", and
   will #define "efloat32_exists" and "efloat64_exists" accordingly.

 * For each of these types, the header will declare functions to convert
   between integer and floating point types, for easier (de)serialization:

	efloat64 int64_to_efloat64(int64_t i)
	efloat64 uint64_to_efloat64(uint64_t i)
	uint64_t efloat64_to_uint64(efloat64 f)
	int64_t efloat64_to_int64(efloat64 f)

 * Additionally, an equivilent to the "fpclassify" function from math.h
   is provided:
	enum efloat_class {
		ef_nan = 0,
		ef_inf = 1,
		ef_zero = 2,
		ef_subnorm = 3,
		ef_normal = 4
	};
	enum efloat_class efloat64_classify(efloat64 f)
   The enum efloat_class values are mapped to the same values as math.h.

 * Functions for extracting infromation from the float are provided:

	enum efloat_class efloat64_radix_2_to_fields(efloat64 f,
	                                             uint8_t *sign,
	                                             int16_t *exponent,
	                                             uint64_t *significand)

	efloat64 efloat64_radix_2_from_fields(uint8_t sign,
	                                      int16_t exponent,
	                                      uint64_t significand,
	                                      enum efloat_class *efloat64class)


Usage
-----

The "tests" directory contains an example usage which shows round trip
conversion between integer and floating point types, as well as comparing
to the host platform's math.h version of fpclassify.


Building
--------
The included Makefile shows an exaple; try "make check"
